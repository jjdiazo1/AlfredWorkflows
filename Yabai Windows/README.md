## Prerequisites

### What is Yabai?
[Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) is a powerful window manager for macOS that enables you to control and manipulate windows on your screen through keyboard shortcuts and scripts. It uses the concept of *spaces* (virtual desktops) and tiling window management to help users quickly and efficiently organize their workspace. 

### Requirements:
- **Yabai** must be installed and configured on your system. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Installing-yabai) to set it up. I also recommend [this tutorial](https://www.josean.com/posts/yabai-setup) by Josean Martinez.
- **Alfred** must be installed along with the Powerpack, which is required to use workflows.
- **Scripting permissions** must be enabled for Alfred to allow it to run the `yabai` commands.

## Workflow Hotkeys

This workflow provides several hotkeys for quickly managing windows and spaces using Yabai commands. Each hotkey runs a specific script to move windows between spaces or perform other Yabai-related actions.

## How to Use

1. Install Yabai and ensure it's running.
2. Download and import the Alfred workflow into Alfred.
3. Use the hotkeys listed above to move windows between spaces or navigate between windows.


### Hotkeys and Commands

You can check them and change them by double clicking the scripts at the right of each command in the alfred workflow editor.

## Customization

You can customize the hotkeys and modify the Yabai commands by editing the workflow in Alfred:
- Open Alfred Preferences > Workflows.
- Select the **Yabai Windows** workflow.
- Modify the hotkeys or change the `yabai` commands in the "Run Script" actions.

To see a more complete list of all commands there's [Commands.txt](https://github.com/jjdiazo1/AlfredWorkflows/blob/8eed166a82939b3f251b09900498a384fe8d7cba/Yabai%20Windows/Commands.txt) under this same directory.

## Troubleshooting

If the hotkeys are not working:
- Ensure that Yabai is properly installed and running.
- Verify that scripting permissions are enabled for Alfred in **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy** > **Privacy** > **Automation**.
- Check Yabai's configuration file (`~/.yabairc`) for any issues.
