# Kaomoji Search Workflow

This Alfred workflow allows you to search through a collection of over 100+ kaomojis and copy them directly to your clipboard.

## Keyword

- `k {query}`

Start typing `k` followed by a search query (e.g., "happy", "sad", etc.) to filter through the available kaomojis.

## How to Use

1. Activate Alfred and type `k` followed by a keyword to search for kaomojis.
2. As you type, the list will narrow down to show relevant kaomojis.
3. Press `Enter` on the desired kaomoji to put it directly where your cursor is.

## Example

Type `k happy` to find kaomojis like `٩(◕‿◕｡)۶`. Press `Enter` and it will directly be put wherever your cursor is.
